                        Being active most days of the week will make it easier for you to manage your blood glucose.
                        At the same time, it can help you lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, manage your
                        weight, sleep better and deal with stress.<br/><br/>
                        Aim to be active most days of the week for at least 30 minutes. If that sounds like too much,
                        set a goal to do 10 minutes of activity, three times a day. It’s OK to start out slow and work
                        your way up.<br/><br/>
                        Choose one or two activities that you might enjoy doing. Walking is a great choice because you
                        can walk just about anywhere, and you don’t need a gym membership or expensive equipment.
                        However, swimming, dancing, tennis and bicycling are good options, too. Find something that you
                        like to do so that you’re more likely to stick with it.

                        Check blood sugar 3-4 times a day (usually before eating a meal). In the event of
                        consistently high sugars, it is recommended to check the blood sugar before eating a meal,
                        as well as 2 hours after each meal.<br/><br/>

                        Take your breakfast on time and avoid skipping your meals because when you have diabetes,
                        what matters is how much you are eating and what you are eating throughout the day.<br/><br/>

                        Write down portions of each food you should consume and stick to that portion size to know
                        the exact carbohydrate count consumed. Make sure your meal is a well balanced and
                        nutritious one<br/><br/>
                        Walking, jogging, working out, light aerobics, or dancing can help you maintain a healthy
                        weight and also help in keeping your blood sugar levels in control.<br/><br/>

                        For people with diabetes, getting enough sleep is important because lack of sleep can make
                        it more challenging to manage blood sugar levels. At least 6-7 hours of sleep is mandatory
                        every night to function at their best the next day.

                        Finding out that you have a chronic condition like diabetes is scary, and it’s normal for you
                        to feel frightened, sad or stressed. It’s important to deal with stress because stress can raise
                        your glucose levels. And when you’re under stress, you’re less likely to take care of yourself.
                        Stress may not go away, but there are ways to lower it. These include:<br/><br/>
                        <li>Doing some type of physical activity.</li>
                        <li>Talking with a friend or loved one.</li>
                        <li>Gardening.</li>
                        <li>Watching a favorite movie.</li>
                        <li>Taking a nap.</li>
                        <li>Doing yoga or meditation.</li>
                        <li>You might also find that joining a diabetes support group can be helpful, either in-person or online.</li>
                        <li>If you can’t seem to shake feelings of sadness, you may be depressed. Depression is more
                            common in people with diabetes than in people without diabetes. Taking care of diabetes is
                            hard, and you may feel alone. Having complications of diabetes,
                            such as heart disease can also lead to depression. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help
                            if you feel down.</li>
                        <li>Do your best to make time to take care of yourself. That means getting seven to eight
                            hours of sleep each night, eating regular meals, making time for physical activity and
                            surrounding yourself with people who care about you.</li>

                        Smokers are 30 to 40 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than nonsmokers. Smoking
                        can also make managing the disease and regulating insulin levels more difficult because
                        high levels of nicotine can lessen the effectiveness of insulin, causing smokers to need more
                        insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Without proper management, diabetes can lead to health
                        problems, including but not limited to:<br/><br/>
                        <li>Heart disease.</li>
                        <li>Blindness.</li>

                        All carbs affect blood glucose levels so it’s important to know which foods contain
                        carbohydrates. Choose the healthier foods that contain carbs and be aware of your portion sizes.
                        Here are some healthy sources of carbohydrates:<br/><br/>
                        <li>Fruit.</li>
                        <li>Vegetables.</li>
                        <li>Whole grains, such as brown rice, buckwheat and whole oats.</li>
                        <li>Pulses, such as chickpeas, beans and lentils.</li>
                        <li>Dairy, such as unsweetened yoghurt and milk.</li><br/>
                        At the same time, it’s also important to cut down on foods low in fibre such as white bread,
                        white rice and highly-processed cereals. You can check food labels when you’re looking for
                        foods high in fibre if you’re unsure.

                            Eating lots of salt can increase your risk of high blood pressure, which in turn increases
                            risk of heart diseases and stroke. And when you have diabetes, you’re already more at
                            risk of all of these conditions.<br/><br/>
                            Try to limit yourself to a maximum of 6g (one teaspoonful) of salt a day. Lots of
                            pre-packaged foods already contain salt so remember to check food labels and choose those
                            with less salt. Cooking from scratch will help you keep an eye on how much salt you’re
                            eating. You can also get creative and swap out salt for different types of herbs and
                            spices to add that extra flavour.

                        If you’re cutting down on carbs, you might start to have bigger portions of meat to fill you
                        up. But it’s not a good idea to do this with red and processed meat, like ham, bacon, sausages,
                        beef and lamb. These all have links with heart problems and cancers. Try swapping red and processed
                        meat for these:<br/><br/>
                        <li>Eggs.</li>
                        <li>Fish.</li>
                        <li>Unsalted nuts.</li>
                        <li>Pulses, such as beans and lentils.</li>
                        <li>Poultry, like chicken and turkey.</li><br/>
                        Beans, peas and lentils are also very high in fibre and don’t affect your blood glucose levels
                        too much – making them a great swap for processed and red meat and keeping you feeling full.
                        Most of us know that fish is good for us, but oily fish like salmon and mackerel are even
                        better. These are rich in something called omega-3 oil, which helps protect your heart.
                        Try and aim to eat two portions of oily fish a week.

                </header>

                    <ul class="accordion__description">
                        We know eating fruit and veg is good for you. It’s always a good thing aim to eat more at meal
                        times and have them as snacks if you’re hungry. This can help you get the vitamins,
                        minerals and fibre your body needs every day to help keep you healthy.<br/><br/>

                        You might be wondering about fruit and if you should avoid it because it’s sugary? The answer
                        is no. Whole fruit is good for everyone and if you have diabetes, it’s no different. Fruits do
                        contain sugar, but it’s natural sugar. This is different to the added sugar (also known as free
                        sugars) that are in things like chocolate, biscuits and cakes.<br/><br/>

                        Products like fruit juices also count as added sugar, so go for whole fruit instead. This can
                        be fresh, frozen, dried or tinned (in juice, not in syrup). And it’s best to eat it throughout
                        the day instead of one bigger portion in one go.

                        We all need fat in our diet because it gives us energy. But different types of fat affect our
                        health in different ways. Healthier fats are in foods like unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados,
                        oily fish, olive oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Some saturated fats can increase the
                        amount of cholesterol in your blood, increasing your risk of heart problems. These are mainly
                        found in animal products and prepared food like:<br/><br/>
                        <li>Red and processed meat.</li>

                        It’s still a good idea to cut down on using oils in general, so try to grill, steam or bake foods instead.

                        We know cutting out sugar can be really hard at the beginning, so small practical swaps are a
                        good starting point when you’re trying to cut down on excess sugar. Swapping sugary drinks,
                        energy drinks and fruit juices with water, plain milk, or tea and coffee without sugar can be
                        a good start.<br/><br/>
                        You can always try low or zero-calorie sweeteners (also known as artificial sweeteners) to help
                        you cut back. Cutting out these added sugars can help you control your blood glucose levels and
                        help keep your weight down. If your diabetes treatment means you get hypos, and you use sugary
                        drinks to treat them, this is still important for your diabetes management and you shouldn’t
                        cut this out. However, if you are having regular hypos it is really important to discuss this
                        with your diabetes team.

                        Alcohol is high in calories, so if you do drink and you’re trying to lose weight, think about
                        cutting back. Try to keep to a maximum of 14 units a week. But spread it out to avoid binge
                        drinking, and go several days a week without alcohol.<br/><br/>
                        If you take insulin or other diabetes medications, it’s also not a good idea to drink on an
