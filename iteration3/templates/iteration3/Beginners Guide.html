                        Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high.
                        Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone
                        made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.
                        Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose
                        then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.<br/><br/>

                        There are 3 main types: Type 1, Type 2 and gestational diabetes. They are all complex and serious.<br><br>
                        <b><u>Type 1 diabetes:</u></b><br>
                        Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease. In people with type 1 diabetes, cells in the pancreas that
                        make insulin are destroyed, so the body is unable to make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that
                        helps your body’s cells use glucose (sugar) for energy. Your body gets glucose from the food
                        you eat. Insulin allows the glucose to pass from your blood into your body’s cells. When the
                        cells have enough, your liver and muscle tissues store the extra glucose in the form of glycogen.
                        It’s broken down into blood sugar and released when you need energy between meals, during exercise,
                        or while you sleep. With type 1 diabetes, your body is unable to process glucose due to the lack
                        of insulin. Glucose from your food can’t make its way into your cells. This leaves too much
                        glucose circulating in your blood.<br/><br/>
                        Type 1 diabetes is a chronic medical condition where cells that make insulin are destroyed,
                        hence the body is unable to process glucose due to the lack of insulin.<br><br>

                        Type 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which the levels of sugar, or glucose,
                        build up in your bloodstream. Typically, the hormone insulin helps move glucose from your blood
                        to your cells, where it’s used for energy. But with type 2 diabetes, your body’s cells aren’t
                        able to respond to insulin as well as they should. In later stages of the condition, your body
                        may also not produce enough insulin. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes can lead to chronically high
                        blood glucose levels, which can cause several symptoms and potentially lead to serious
                        complications. <br/><br/>

                       <b><u>Gestational Diabetes:</u></b><br>
                        During pregnancy, some people may develop high blood sugar levels. This condition is known as
                        gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes typically
                        develops between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy. If you develop gestational diabetes
                        while you’re pregnant, it doesn’t mean that you had diabetes before your pregnancy or will have
                        it afterward. But gestational diabetes does raise your risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the
                        future. If poorly managed, it can also raise your child’s chance of developing diabetes and
                        increase the possibility of complications for you and your baby during pregnancy and delivery.<br/><br/>

                        Gestational diabetes typically develops between the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy. Although
                        not indicative of having diabetes before or after pregnancy, it raises the risk of type 2

                        Low blood glucose is common among people with type 1 diabetes and among people with type 2
                        diabetes who take insulin or some other diabetes medicines. Low blood glucose levels can be
                        a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into
                        your blood. But severely low blood glucose can cause serious complications, including passing
                        out, coma, or death.<br>

                        The signs and symptoms of low blood glucose are easy to recognize:<br>
                        •         Rapid heartbeat<br>
                        •         Sweating<br>
                        •         Whiteness of skin<br>
                        •         Anxiety<br>
                        •         Numbness in fingers, toes, and lips<br>
                        •         Sleepiness<br>
                        •         Confusion<br>
                        •         Headaches<br>
                        •         Slurred speech<br/><br/>
                        Mild cases of hypoglycemia can be treated by drinking orange juice or eating a glucose tablet—
                        those will quickly raise your blood glucose level.<br/><br/>

                        <b><u>Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic Nonketotic Syndrome:</u></b><br>
                        Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS) is very rare, but you should be aware of
                        it and know how to handle it if it occurs. HHNS is when your blood glucose level goes way too
                        high, and if you don’t treat it, it can cause death.<br/><br/>
                        HHNS is most likely to occur when you’re sick, and elderly people are most likely to develop it.
                        It starts when your blood glucose level starts to climb: when that happens, your body will try
                        to get rid of all the excess glucose through frequent urination. That dehydrates your body,
                        and you’ll become very thirsty.<br/><br/>
                        Unfortunately, when you’re sick, you can’t always rehydrate your body as you should. You might
                        have trouble keeping fluids down, for example. When you don’t rehydrate your body, the blood
                        glucose level continues to climb, and it can eventually go so high that it will send you into a coma. <br/><br/>
                        To avoid hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome, you should keep close watch on your
                        blood glucose level when you’re sick (you should always pay attention to your blood glucose
                        level, but pay special attention when you’re sick).<br/><br/>

                                also can lower the amount of blood flow in your feet. Not having enough blood flowing
                                to your legs and feet can make it hard for a sore or an infection to heal. Sometimes,
                                a bad infection never heals. The infection might lead to gangrene.<br/>

                                High blood glucose, also called blood sugar, can damage the blood vessels in your
                                kidneys. When the blood vessels are damaged, they don’t work as well.
                                Many people with diabetes also develop high blood pressure, which can also damage
                                your kidneys. When your kidneys are damaged, they can’t filter blood like they should, which can cause wastes to build up in your body.<br/>

                                <b><u>Eye Disease</u></b><br>
                                Diabetic eye disease is a group of eye problems that can affect people with diabetes.
                                these conditions include diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, cataracts, and
                                glaucoma. Over time, diabetes can cause damage to your eyes that can lead to poor
                                vision or even blindness. In the short term, you are not likely to have vision loss
                                from high blood glucose. People sometimes have blurry vision for a few days or weeks.
                                If your blood glucose stays high over time, it can damage the tiny blood vessels in
                                the back of your eyes. This damage can begin during prediabetes, when blood glucose is
                                higher than normal, but not high enough for you to be diagnosed with diabetes. Damaged
                                blood vessels may leak fluid and cause swelling. New, weak blood vessels may also begin
                                to grow. These blood vessels can bleed into the middle part of the eye, lead to
                                scarring, or cause dangerously high pressure inside your eye.<br/>

                        A healthy eating plan is important for everyone who has diabetes. You don’t need to follow a
                        strict diet, but you will likely need to make some changes in order to keep your blood glucose
                        levels in your target range. An eating plan can also help you lose weight and control your blood
                        pressure and cholesterol, as well. Here are foods to include in your diabetes eating plan:<br/><br/>
